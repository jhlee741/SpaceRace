# SpaceRace
***Due to academic regulations from UofT, the code will not be made public***

The objective of ***Space Race*** is to navigate a rocket through a randomly generated asteroid field to pick up "coins". It is a two player game, to win you must collect more "coins" than your opponent. Each time you get across you gain a point. If you get hit with an obstacle, one point gets subtracted from your score. The game was programmed in C for an ARMv7 DE1-SOC FPGA board with a VGA display.
